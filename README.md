# Pet Paradigm
This prototype was created for an assigment. The objective was to redesign an existing website. The new design required understanding stakeholder and user needs, creating personas, wireframes and then finally a prototype. 

This prototype is very minimally functional and is used to highlight the primary and secondary navigational elements, information architecture, and micro-interactions needed to meet user and stakeholder needs.

It was created using HTML and CSS only.
