                        The domestic dog is an extremely social animal and offers a diverse variety of choices as there
                        are well over 300 breeds recognized by the World Canine Organization. Adopting a dog offers
                        mutual benefits between dog and owner. Many studies cite the social benefits of having a
                        companion as well as the reduced feelings of loneliness from adopting a dog. Studies even show
                        medical indicators such as <a

                            pressure and improved lipid profiles.</a> If you have a dog, it is important to make sure
                        that you care for your dog; be mindful of what you feed your dog and provide enough
                        opportunities for exercise. In this page, you will find more information about how to care
                        for your pets throughout the various stages of their lives. </p>

                        Throughout dogs’ lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer meals as they mature. Puppies
                        should be nursed the first two months, then introduced to three meals per day when they are
                        about three to six months years old. Their food intake should be reduced to two meals per day
                        when they are six months to one year old and finally reduced to one meal after they reach one
                        year old. And a dog’s typical body mass is composed of somewhere between 60 and 70 percent
                        water. The <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-nutrition-tips"
                            target="_blank">ASPCA</a> says just a 10 percent decrease in body water can cause illness,
                        and a 15
                        percent loss can cause death, so make sure you keep your pooch hydrated!

                        Much like humans, dogs need to have a healthy level of activity to keep their organs healthy, as
                        well as sun and fresh air. The minimum recommended time for exercise varies greatly with breed
                        and size differences, but generally a range of 30–120 minutes of exercise is recommended per
                        day! Can you imagine exercising two hours per day? OK, I know that wouldn't bother some of you
                        reading this. But the thought of it to me makes me cringe! And by the way, exercising your dog
                        does not mean you are being challenged to a push-up contest. Brisk walks are OK too! You can
                        also choose from a variety of toys to encourage physical activity; just be sure they are age
                        appropriate and do not pose a choking hazard. Pay careful attention to toys that require
                        supervision.

                        Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health. So be sure to brush
                        frequently to reduce the amount of shedding and prevent matted and tangled fur that can prove to
                        be extremely difficult to remove. Check for insects such as ticks and fleas, especially after
                        visiting heavily wooded areas. Bathing is not only important to your dog’s health but can be an
                        exercise depending on how strong willed the dog is. Rinse <strong>all</strong> of the soap out,
                        as any residual soap can result in a rash. Be sure the soap is formulated for your puppy or dog,
                        since harsh soaps can cause allergic reactions. And as always, be careful how you handle your
                        loved one. No matter the size of your dog, you need to be cautious as you carry your canine. If
                        you have a small dog, then cradle the pup with one hand under the chest and the forearm
                        supporting the back half. If it is a large dog, reach under the belly with both your arms
                        perpendicular to the dog, and use each arm to support the chest and rear as you lift.

                        You should <strong>always</strong> consult with your veterinarian, but there is a core set of
                        vaccines that are
                        typically recommended. Vaccines that reduce the exposure risk to things such as hepatitis,
                        rabies, and parvovirus. Others may be determined by your vet depending on the environment in
                        which the dog resides. Some of these include <a
