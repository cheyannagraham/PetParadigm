                        Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region and are currently the
                        second
                        most popular domestic pet in the United States. While there are over 60 unique documented cat
                        breeds, care and diet can differ between breeds. However, some diets and practices are generally
                        recommended for the well-being of your fluffy family member regardless of breed.

                        It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat that is either pregnant or
                        nursing)
                        directly nurse her young if possible. Monitor your kittenâ€™s growth closely to make sure its
                        growth
                        rate is progressing steadily. If any kitten is not growing at a sufficient rate, a caretaker
                        might
                        need to feed the kitten directly either with a bottle or a feeding tube. Some reasons why
                        kittens
                        might not gain weight appropriately include the following:

                        Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically around three to four weeks
                        after birth. According to the <a
                            href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips">ASPCA</a>, kittens at this
                        age
                        should eat half to one cup of dry kitten
                        food or six to nine ounces of wet kitten food per day. If your kitten has difficulties eating
                        hard
                        food, a small amount of water can be added to soften the food. Cat food that is optimized for
                        kittens provides the additional nutrients that are needed for growth, energy, and wellness.
                        Depending on the breed, your cat may have different dietary requirements. You should always
                        consult
                        with your veterinarian for recommendations.

                        This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as many nutrients. At this age,
                        their
                        level of activity decreases, and so does their metabolism. It is <strong>not</strong>
                        recommended to
                        leave food out for the cats all day. Instead, provide food a couple times a day so they eat
                        meals
                        rather than snacking throughout the day. This practice reduces the risk of obesity and other
                        weight-related feline ailments.

                        Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and experience a lot of changes.
                        Cats at this age should eat less fats and calories and more quality proteins. This means when
                        you
                        are purchasing packaged foods for your cat, look for food that states a particular protein (such
                        as
                        "salmon") and <strong>not</strong> just a category (such as fish). This usually means they are
                        byproducts, or combinations, of lesser quality proteins.
